(`cloud-itonami-lei-corporate-tos-catalog`, `com-junkawasaki/root`). It is a read-only

## Design rationale

See ADR-2607110300 in `com-junkawasaki/root` (`90-docs/adr/`) for why this repo exists,
why it is keyed by LEI rather than GTIN or ticker, and why full-text archival (with
provenance) was chosen over excerpt-only storage.
